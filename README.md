SpeedTyper
-----
A ncurses based speed typing application, currently geared toward learning to touch type on a Dvorak keyboard layout.

Unfortunately it is currently in a non-working state, I should have used version control sooner. I was pulled away from it in the middle of an overhaul and lost a bit of progress and a bit of clarity. Updates await, but I wanted it under version control before it was lost for good.

ToDo:
-Make it actually work again, first off.
-Add option to add symbols to existing dictionary words. (Parentheticals, quotes, <<>> brackets, [] brackets, etc.)
-Cleaner code.
-Better scoring system.
